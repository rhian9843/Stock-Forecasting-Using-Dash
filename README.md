# Stock Forecasting using Dash

Created an interactive Dash app to visualize dynamic plots of closing prices and exponential moving averages for user-specified stock codes.

Integrated a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict closing stock prices for a user-defined number of future days.

Enhanced user experience with a real-time, user-friendly interface for accurate stock forecasting and analysis.


## Project Structure

1) app.py contains web layout and server function. We will be referring to it as our main file.

2) model.py is where we will implement a machine learning model for forecasting the stock price.

3) style.css is the css file for styling the web app.

4) requirements.txt is correct versions of the required Python packages to run the Python code.
